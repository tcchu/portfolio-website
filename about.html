  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>When I'm designing, I seek out the correct problems to solve backed by user research and strategically map out task flows to ensure the design has utility and is user friendly.</p>
  <p>I am a turned UX Designer, previously a Test Engineer and Engineering Project Manager.  I enjoy iterating designs followed by usability testing to ensure user problems are being met with the correct solution.</p>
  <p>With a mixed background in Mechanical Engineering and Business, I have a holistic approach to bringing products from concept to launch.</p>
